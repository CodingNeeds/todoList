check the db tables and statuses not from my code but from the actual db connected, audit if 
- the tasks have student id,
- the doability of adding todolist (checkboxes tasks) generated by an llm workflow in n8n (should be put with the rest of the workflows in json file student-tasks-existing-schema.json) generated and formatted to work with the platform here (audit also the preparability and the planning to integrate this )
- the doability and planning for adding manually a task (a full one with its inner checkboxes)
